# Cyber Exposure in Israel â€” Shodan Snapshot (2025)

**Author:** Alex (Pentesting / OSINT)  
**Date:** 2025-08-17

## 1) Goal
Provide an aggregate, ethical snapshot of internet-exposed services in Israel using the Shodan API to highlight attack surface trends and awareness points.

## 2) Methodology
- Data source: Shodan search + facets (no active scanning)
- Base query: `country:IL -tag:honeypot`
- ICS focus: `tag:ics`
- Vulnerabilities: `has_vuln:true` with CVE facets
- Publication policy: aggregate numbers only, no IPs/hostnames in public report

## 3) Key Findings (replace with your numbers)
- Top exposed ports: see figure below.
- Top organizations/ASNs with exposed hosts.
- ICS exposure: sample counts by product.
- Vulnerability presence: top CVEs seen in banners.

## 4) Figures

## 5) Observations & PT relevance
- Publicly exposed RDP/SMB/DB services elevate brute-force and lateral movement risks.
- ICS/SCADA exposure increases potential safety/availability impact.
- Banner-advertised vulnerabilities indicate patching gaps and asset inventory challenges.

## 6) Recommendations
- Enforce perimeter policy: close unused ports, require VPN for admin interfaces.
- Asset management: inventory, owner assignment, patch SLAs.
- Network segmentation and MFA for remote access.
- Continuous external attack surface monitoring.

## 7) Limitations
- Shodan coverage is periodic; counts are approximate.
- Facet counts aggregate banners; presence of CVE does not imply exploitability.
- ICS identification can be banner-dependent and incomplete.
